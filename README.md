# Cold-Start Problem in Recommender Systems

## Description
This project explores the **cold-start problem** in recommender systems, where the challenge lies in recommending items to users with little to no prior ratings. The focus of this notebook is to compare **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **Meta-Learning** approaches for predicting ratings for unseen users.

## Motivation
The cold-start problem arises when a recommender system struggles to make accurate predictions for users who have not interacted with many items. This is common in real-world systems where new users join without providing enough data. My goal is to compare the following:
- Traditional collaborative filtering (SVD).
- Exploring a meta-learning approach to handle the adaptation to new users with minimal data.

## Approach
1. **SVD-based Collaborative Filtering**:
   - I used **SVD** (Singular Value Decomposition) from the `Surprise` library to predict ratings for new users, leveraging their limited ratings and item interactions.
   
2. **Neural Network for Cold-Start**:
   - The dataset was split into known and unknown ratings for users, with the idea that the model could learn from the known ratings and predict the unknown ones.
   - A basic neural network model was used to predict ratings based on the known ratings, with **padding** applied to make the sequences uniform in length.

3. **Cold-Start Data Preparation**:
   - I implemented a function that identifies **cold-start users**—those who have rated fewer items—and prepares the data accordingly.
   
4. **Evaluation**:
   - The model performance is evaluated using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** to determine how well it predicts ratings for cold-start users.

## Future Work
While this notebook provides a solution to the cold-start problem, there are several potential avenues for further development:
- **Full Meta-Learning Implementation**: The current approach uses a simple neural network to predict ratings, but a more sophisticated meta-learning algorithm (like MAML or Few-Shot Learning) could improve the adaptability of the model to new users.
- **Task-based Learning**: Implementing a model that learns from multiple user-specific tasks could lead to better generalization for new users with minimal data.
- **Integrating Other Techniques**: Exploring hybrid models that combine collaborative filtering with content-based features could also help in solving the cold-start problem more effectively.
- **Fair Comparison between models.**

## Requirements
- **Libraries**: This project uses Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, and `surprise`. These can be installed using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn surprise
